<h1 style="font-weight: normal; color: #e60d68;">Marianne Wagner</h1>
Marianne studied modern languages in Antwerp where she obtained her diploma from the Goethe Institut and the Alliance Fran√ßaise. She came back to Belgium to run a franchised business Travel Agency in Brussels in 1994. She worked at Mercuri Urval in 1998, before State Street Global Advisors (an American asset management company) offered her a position as office manager, a position she had to build from scratch. Marianne was the personal assistant to the Head of Europe.<br /><br />In 2004 Marianne won the Management Assistant of the Year award, which opened new doors. A new challenge came across in 2010, when she was asked by Myriam Ullens de Schooten to manage the Mimi Foundation, a foundation that endeavours to lower the sufferance of cancer patients during their treatment. At the moment Marianne is the Managing Director for Belgium, France and Switzerland.
